Requirements
Objective: As a product owner, I want to build a responsive interest calculator web application.

Features:

-The application should provide options to choose the duration for interest calculation: Daily, Monthly, and Yearly.
-Users should be able to input the principal amount.
-Users should be able to select the interest rate from a predefined list of rates up to 15%.
-The application should calculate the correct interest based on the selected duration, principal amount, and interest rate.
-The application should display the calculated interest and the total amount including interest.
-All input fields (principal amount, interest rate, duration and consent) are mandatory.
-For simplicity, the calculated interest and total amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

The application should inform the user if any field is left empty or not selected. - Not complete


**Ambiguous Requirements. Business clarification is required to write test cases**


The application should be responsive and user-friendly.
Clear error messages should be displayed to guide users in case of missing or incorrect inputs.
